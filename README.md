A. What is an issue? 
An issue is a ticket or an item in a project repository that tracks a task, a bug that needs to be fixed, or any actionable item related to the project's development. 

B. What is a pull request? 
A pull request is a part of the collaboration process for writing codes. When multiple individuals work on the same repository, each person create a new branch to isolate their changes from the main branch. Once the changes are ready to be reviewed and merged, a pull request is made to merge the changes from their individual branch into another branch (usually the main branch). 

C. How do I open up a pull request? 
Assuming that I already have a separate branch in which I have made some changes that are committed and pushed onto GitHub. I would open my repository on GitHub in a web broswer, switch to my branch, click on "Pull Requests", and then click on "New pull request", and finally "Create pull request". 

D. Give a step by step guide on how to add someone to your repository 
1. In my web broswer, navigate to my repository in GitHub. 
2. Go to settings of my repository. 
3. Click on "Collaborators" on the left panel. 
4. Click on "Add people" under "Manage access". 
5. Type in collaborators' credentials (username, full name, or email). 
6. Click on "Add <username>" to send an invitation.

F. what does git diff do?
