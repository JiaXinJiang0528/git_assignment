A. What is an issue? 
An issue is a ticket or an item in a project repository that tracks a task, a bug that needs to be fixed, or any actionable item related to the project's development. 

B. What is a pull request? 
A pull request is a part of the collaboration process for writing codes. When multiple individuals work on the same repository, each person create a new branch to isolate their changes from the main branch. Once the changes are ready to be reviewed and merged, a pull request is made to merge the changes from their individual branch into another branch (usually the main branch). 

C. How do I open up a pull request? 
Assuming that I already have a separate branch in which I have made some changes that are committed and pushed onto GitHub. I would open my repository on GitHub in a web broswer, switch to my branch, click on "Pull Requests", and then click on "New pull request", and finally "Create pull request". 


D. Give a step by step guide on how to add someone to your repository 
1. In my web broswer, navigate to my repository in GitHub. 
2. Go to settings of my repository. 
3. Click on "Collaborators" on the left panel. 
4. Click on "Add people" under "Manage access". 
5. Type in collaborators' credentials (username, full name, or email). 
6. Click on "Add <username>" to send an invitation. 


E. What is the difference between git and GitHub? 
Git is a local version control system that allows people to track changes in their codes and manage different versions of their repository/projects. It can be used locally on your own computer. 

GitHub is a web platform that hosts repositories and offers collaborative tools like pull requests and issues, in addition to tracking changes made to the repository.  


F. what does git diff do? 
The git diff command can be used to compare files between different states in the repository. "Git diff" alone will show which files are in the working directory vs. files in the staging area ready for commit. "Git diff --staged" will show files in the staging area vs. the most recent commit. Git diff is a tool I can use to inspect changes and understand modifications made in the repository. 


G. What is the main branch? 

H. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the main branch?
